# Exercise 12-6

This exercise uses concepts from the book Python Crash Course, Chapter 12.

The goal of this program is to place an image of a ship directed towards the right side of the screen instead of the middle of the screen. 
The bullets that the ship can use must now be directed from left to right as opposed to directly up the screen.
